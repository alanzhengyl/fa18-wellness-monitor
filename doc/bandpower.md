# Bandpower
This bandpower block calculates the average power of the FFT input signal in a parameterizable frequency range. First, the two-sided spectrum `p2` is calculated by taking the absolute value of the input. (While the true spectrum would involve a division by the signal length, this step is omitted because division is expensive, and in this case, only relative bandpowers matter anyway.) Next, the single-sided spectrum `p1` is computed. With the exception of the DC and sampling frequency elements (the first element and the "central" element of `p2`), the values are doubled. Finally, the values in the bins of interest are squared and the summed to find the power in the band of interest.

This block is currently designed to receive the entire signal in parallel via a bus, but this may be redesigned in the future. The length of the FFT input signal and the start and end bins are given as parameters to this block. Conversion of frequency range to bin number is done by a higher level block.
