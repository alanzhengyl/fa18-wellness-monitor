# FIR Filter
This FIR Filter Generator takes a set of coefficients of any desired length and type and generates an FIR filter with a `ValidWithSync` interface for input/output streams. This version generates an FIR filter with constant coefficients as it is only intended as a Low Pass/Band Pass filter generator with constant corner frequencies.
